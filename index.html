        <h1>My Favorite City: Bellevue, WA</h1>
        <h2>The Pearl of Washington</h2>
        <p>
            Beautiful parks, a vibrant dining scene, safe streets, and a wide variety of shops are defining features of
            this pristine Eastside city. With plenty of activities, attractions, and culinary experiences, there's
            something for everything in Bellevue. I recommend attending Snowflake Lane and the Bellevue Arts Fair in
            particular when they're in season, but regardless of the season, it's difficult to go wrong in this city.

        <h2>Attractions</h2>

            <h3>Meydenbauer Bay Park</h3>
            <p>
                Bellevue Downtown Park often gets the most attention, but just half&#45;a&#45;mile to the west is one of
                Washington's best waterfront parks. Despite its proximity to the city center, Meydenbauer Bay is very
                quiet and offers respite from the bustle of downtown. This park was also originally a landing site for
                passenger ferries between Seattle and Bellevue between the 1890s and 1921. While ferry service has
                stopped since, seasonal canoe and kayak rentals are available and non&#45;motorized watercraft can be
                launched here. If you'd happen to own a yacht and would like to park it there instead, you could join
                the nearby yacht club &#45; but you'll have to join a four year long waitlist.

            <h3>The Bellevue Collection</h3>
            <p>
                It's the quintessential reason &quot;to visit Bellevue&#58;&quot; Bellevue Square. Opened in 1946,
                Bellevue Square has over 200 retail stores including Macy's and Nordstrom, and is among one of the last
                privately held malls in the US. Spanning several blocks of downtown, this massive mall has something for
                everyone. Visitors looking for greater food options can visit nearby Lincoln Square, and luxury hotels
                and apartments are embedded in Lincoln Square and Bellevue Place. Just don't expect any of this to be
                easy on your wallet.

            <h3>Bellevue Arts Fair &#45; Summer</h3>
            <p>
                This annual historic arts fair hosted in July is one of Bellevue's core events, and it continues to
                leave an impact on the region's art scene. Starting as a small parking lot event in the 70s, the fair
                now spans several city blocks and businesses. More than 350 artists exhibit their works over 20
                different mediums, while food trucks, live music, and activities for kids ensure that everybody is
                happy. It's also responsible for some of my fondest childhood memories.

            <h3>Snowflake Lane &#45; Winter</h3>
            <p>
                Snowflake Lane is Bellevue's most iconic holiday event. Initially created as a small festivity in 2005,
                it has become a month-long affair with a nightly parade that attracts thousands of people from across
                the state. 250 cast members performing as elves, drummers, teddy bears, and more march along Bellevue
                Way underneath the night lights as 55 snow machines drizzle snow onto the crowd. Many Bellevue residents
                can recall watching the parade and receiving candy as children &#45; me included!
